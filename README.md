# Handwriting-to-Text-Recognition

Developing a robust deep learning model for handwritten text recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to create an accurate and efficient system capable of accurately transcribing handwritten text images into machine-encoded text. The model needs to process varied handwriting styles, sizes, and orientations, and be capable of recognizing and transcribing individual words or sentences accurately from input images. The objective is to achieve high accuracy and generalization while optimizing the architecture and training methodology to handle real-world handwritten documents effectively. 

*What each file in the repository means:*

1. **data** - Contains all the data used for training and testing, including images of handwritten characters and their corresponding text labels.

2. **main.py** - This is the main driver program for running the application. It loads all necessary modules and calls functions to perform handwriting recognition.

3. **CreatedData** - This is the dataset that we have used which we are using for prediction.

4. **test** - These are a few images from the dataset which we are using for prediction.

5. **model1.h5** - This is the pre-trained model for the network

*How to use:*

1. Download all the files

2. Change the paths wherever necessary in main.ipynb

3. Run main.ipynb

4. If you want to add any more images for testing, add them in CreatedData folder and put the path for testing
